              <p>
                Currently, I'm diving into the world of web development with
                Ironhack's awesome Bootcamp. It's more than just coding; I'm on
                a journey to become a Full-Stack Developer and learn the coolest
                tech skills. I'm drawn to web development because I want to be
                part of something always changing and growing ‚Äì stepping out of
                my comfort zone and exploring a field that's shaping the future.

                It's a combination of enjoying solving challenging problems and
                wanting my code to have a meaningful impact beyond being mere
                lines on a screen. I'm passionate about leveraging my innate
                curiosity and enthusiasm to make a significant mark in the tech
                world.

                I'm proficient in both German and English, and it has proven
                incredibly beneficial in collaborating with diverse individuals
                from various backgrounds.By contributing my unique perspective,
                I enjoy infusing our projects with a global touch.

                My transition from a sales background to web development is
                fueled by a deep-seated desire to align my career with my
                passion for technology, problem-solving, and the dynamic nature
                of the web development landscape. I believe this shift will not
                only challenge and fulfill me but also allow me to contribute
                meaningfully to the innovative and ever-evolving tech industry.
